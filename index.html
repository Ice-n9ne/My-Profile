    <h1>Me</h1>

    <p>Hi, my name is Elliott, I am 29 years old and I’m from
      the Sunshine Coast Queensland.   I’ve grown up spending
      most of my time in the outdoors, doing things like surfing,
      hiking, spearfishing and camping.  I’ve spent the last 8
      years of my life living in Melbourne working in the hospitality
      and beer industry, the last two of which I was a beer plumber!
      Making sure the thirsty people of Melbourne could get a pint
      full of the good stuff!</p>

    <h2>Interest in IT </h2>

    <p>I had my first taste of IT when I was a young child, I would
      watch my older sibling play video games on consoles such as NES,
      SNES and PS1.  Once I had accidently wiped their save files a one
      to many times my parents finally got me and my little brother our
      own set up.  This is where the rabbit hole began.  Sleepless
      hours were spent up late playing whatever we could get our hands
      on, mainly simple platform and racing games, like Crash bandicoot,
      Spyro, RoadRash etc.  Little did I know where gaming was headed,
      and once it had taken off onto the internet my love for IT and
      gaming snowballed.</p>

    <h2>The “WoW” Moment</h2>

    <p>I think downloading and playing WoW (World of Warcraft) on the
      home desktop was my first “Omg the internet can do this” moment,
      and from there IT has never ceased to amaze me.  This vast space
      for people to explore and chat, and share ideas, leaves open such
      a huge door of opportunity for everybody on the planet.  Everything
      is linked, from our finances, our friends, our music tastes and
      something new pops up every other day.</p>

    <h2>Why RMIT?</h2>

    <p>Making it into my late twenties my attitudes towards life has
      change a lot, I’ve grown up, and want to do something stable and
      build a career.  Combine that with my ever-evolving interests in
      the tech world and I ended where I am.  I needed a course that
      was flexible with my lifestyle and my business, and RMIT online
      seemed like a no brainer.  I have a few friends that have done
      similar courses at RMIT on campus, and they said it was great,
      and I thought I would give it a crack.</p>

    <h2>What I Want</h2>

    <p>Studying a bachelor of IT I expect to learn the fundamentals over
      a broad spectrum, by jumping in and learning things like programming,
      web development, AI and more, I hope to gain better understanding
      on what really interests me and where I should focus my studies and
      my career goals.  I would like to eventually study on campus and
      have a bit more of a hands-on approach to learning.  But that is
      still a while away yet.  The added benefit of networking with my
      peers and teachers will no doubt help in the long run.</p>

    <h1>The Ideal Job </h1>

    <img src="images/job.jpg"alt"dream job"/>

    <p>At this moment it is probably game/software development that excites
      me the most about potential career paths.  It opens a world of opportunity
      to delve into my creative side and expand on my skillset.   Being part
      of a team that can help produce a AAA game and bring joy to millions of
      people around the globe would be mind-blowing. </p>

    <h2>The Job</h2>

    <p> <a href="https://careers.unity.com/position/senior-software-developer-external/3493887">This</a>
      position, although not my dream studio would give me the experience needed
      to venture into bigger and better things.   Joining this team would require
      developing software and technologies to best meet our partner’s needs.  I
      would not only be building and developing new technologies but maintaining
      and building-up on already established tech to bring the best potential
      performance to the table.  Personally, I value a good work life balance
      and with Unity’s “Work From Home” program certainly ticks that box</p>

    <h2>What I Need</h2>

    <p>Strong programming skills in C# or C++ and the ability to efficiently
      develop, profile, debug, and optimizer code in multiple-platform
      environments is required to be considered for this job.  As my experience
      and skill sets are still taking form this may be out of reach for me for
      the time being.  On completion of my Bachelor, I hope to be proficient
      enough to step out into the job market and eventually achieve this ideal
      position.</p>

    <h2>What I have</h2>

    <p>Although my technical skills may be sub-par at this stage, I do already
      have the everyday skills that are required for this job.  My years working
      front of house in a team environment have given me excellent communication
      skills, not only with my team but with customers and the general public.
      My ability to work with what I have and to solve problems I have never
      encountered before will give me a leg up as a potential member of the
      team.</p>

    <h2>My Plan</h2>

    <p>As I work through my degree, I will begin to narrow down what aspects of
      IT really interest me, and I will then be able to figure out how I can
      implement them into my skillset, so I can stand out from the pack when
      it comes to landing a job.  I’ve always had a keen eye for design and
      graphics, so hopefully I will one day be able to use that to my
      advantage.</p>

    <h1>Personality Profile</h1>

    <h3>Myers Briggs Type Indicator Results</h3>

    <img src="images/advocate.jpg" alt="advocate avatar">


    <ul>
      <li>Personality type: Advocate (INFJ-T)</li>
      <li>Traits: Introverted – 61%, Intuitive – 88%, Feeling – 67%,
      Judging – 53%, Turbulent – 60%</li>
      <li>Role: Diplomat</li>
      <li>Strategy: Constant Improvement</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Advocate</h2>

    <p>Advocates are the rarest personality types of all. Still, Advocates leave
     their mark on the world. They have a deep sense of idealism and integrity,
     but they aren’t idle dreamers – they take concrete steps to realize their
     goals and make a lasting impact.</p>

    <p>Advocates’ unique combination of personality traits makes them complex
    and quite versatile. For example, Advocates can speak with great passion
    and conviction, especially when standing up for their ideals. At other
    times, however, they may choose to be soft-spoken and understated,
    preferring to keep the peace rather than challenge others.</p>

    <h2>Strengths</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Creative</li>
      <li>Insightful</li>
      <li>Principled</li>
      <li>Passionate</li>
      <li>Altruistic</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Weaknesses</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Sensitive to Critisism</li>
      <li>Reluctant to open up</li>
      <li>Perfectionist</li>
      <li>Avoiding the Ordinary</li>
      <li>Prone to Burnout</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Team Composition </h2>

    <p>As colleagues, Advocates can be quite popular and well-respected. People
      with this personality type are likely to be seen as positive, eloquent,
      and capable co-workers. Among their greatest strengths is their ability
      to identify others’ motives and defuse conflicts and tension before
      anyone else even senses a disturbance.</p>

    <p>At times, efficiency may be less of a priority for Advocates than
      collaborating with and helping colleagues who need a boost. While this is
      usually a strength, there is a risk that others will take advantage of
      their desire to help. Advocates may find themselves picking up the slack
      for their less dedicated co-workers at the expense of their own energy
      and well-being.</p>

    <p>Although they tend to be warm and approachable colleagues, Advocates are
       still Introverts. From time to time, they may need to step back and work
       alone, pursuing their own goals in their own ways.</p>

    <h3>Leadership Styles - USCPrice</h3>

    <h3> Postmodern Leader </h3>

    <p>You understand that leadership is both an art and a science. More than
      most, you recognize the joy available in the role of a leader. The
      pleasure of leadership is realized through the transformation of society
      and the realization of human potential. Leadership is an action that
      brings you greater self-awareness. Your keen awareness helps others see
      their own life in a new light. You help others realize the empowerment
      that comes from creating the future with others.</p>

    <p>Your leadership style is a valuable asset for improving your career
      prospects. A leadership program can help you bring evidence-based
      practices to your work, adding value for your employer. </p>

    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>

    <p>These results must be taken with a grain of salt, but can also give the
      user insight into how their personality shapes them as a team member and
      as a leader.  Many aspects of my results do ring true.  The 16
      personalities test was interesting, with such a large dissection of my
      personality it was bound to have a few questionable answers.
      I wholeheartedly agree with most of the sentiment around Passion,
      creativity, idealism etc.  But I will have to point out things that could
      have been reviewed. I along with ex colleagues of mine would have to
      disagree on the following:  </p>

    <p class="quote">“At other times, however, they may choose to be soft-spoken and
      understated, preferring to keep the peace rather than challenge
      others.”</p>

    <p>Rarely when I have such passion for something will a put myself in
      a possession where I am understated, I do get quite vocal and will
      challenge others and push for a well-mannered debate to find the best
      possible solution for the given problem, without being overbearing and
      unwilling to budge.  Which brings me to my second query with the results
      which suggests I am “sensitive to criticism”. As long as it is criticism
      of a constructive kind I will welcome it with open arms, if it is of
      the negative kind, I do my best to ignore it and walk away. </p>

    <h2>My Behaviour </h2>

    <p>Working in team environments I tend to hold a very high standard in
      projects that me and my team are working on, I am also not afraid to
      make sure I’m heard when I see the standards start to slip.  When I fail
      to get team members motivated and willing to put in the work, I will pick
      up the pieces and take on the extra load myself to get us across the line,
      which inevitably results in me burning out.  But luckily for me burnout
      only occurs on rare occasion. It is becoming more apparent to me in
      adulthood that I have the ability to use my passion and energy to feed
      the people around me, and to motivate them to help pick up the slack.
      But once those reserves have been drained the burnout creeps in.
      Conversely the negative energies can have the same effect.</p>

    <h2>Me in a Team</h2>

    <p>I am not one to put my hand up for the job of becoming a leader in a
      team.  My strengths lie in my ability to getting team member to think for
      themselves, to solve conflict and come up with resolutions to problems
      that will arise.  I find bringing everyone to the same level helps to
      get creative juices flowing and to realise each other’s strengths and
      weaknesses.  Which rings true with the results from the USCPrice
      Leadership styles test.</p>

    <h1>The Idea</h1>

    <p>A community building mobile application, aiming to bring together people
      from the same area to help improve and support the foundations of what it
      means to be part of the neighbourhood, through trade of goods and
      services.  This app will be designed as a trading platform to promote
      the real-life trade of goods and services, instead of traditional fiat
      currencies.  </p>

    <h2>The Motivation</h2>

    <p>As the world becomes more connected through the powers, and ease of
      access of the internet, we are losing touch with what actually got us to
      here in the first place.  Community.  Without community we as a human
      race would have struggled to overcome the many challenges that have
      stood in our way since the dawn of time.  Things like War. Famine.
      Natural disasters. These things would have surely been much more
      catastrophic if it wasn’t for our neighbours and the people who we
      share our towns with.   And now, with access to everything within a
      click of a button, we are losing more and more of that face-to-face
      interaction, every single day.  This app aims to strengthen community
      spirit and to give the everyday person the opportunity to spread the
      love a little.</p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>

    <p>The Applications will take the users personal information, much like many
      others services, such as name, date of birth, email, phone number, email
      and location.  This information will be analysed by experts on regular
      basis and used to improve the user experience when it is to be updated.
      Location is the key factor here; it will use the post code from the user
      details to connect them with others in the same or neighbouring area
      codes (within certain limits). </p>

    <p>From there It will work much like a digital community board, where the
      user posts what product or service, they are able to provide.  If other
      users see something that pertains to their needs, they will have the
      option to contact the original poster in-app and offer a product or
      service that they themselves are willing to provide in exchange.  This is
      where both parties will either, agree on what service they are both to
      exchange, or that the trade is not beneficial to either party, and it will
      be left at that.  </p>

    <p>Trading categories will be implemented into the interface for ease of use.
      These categories can include things like, food (home grown fruit and
      vegetable, fresh eggs, whole meals, baked goods etc.), unskilled services
      (dog walking, car wash, shopping, around the house tasks etc), tradesman
      (handyman, gardener, plumber, electrician etc.), handmade goods (jewellery,
      art, furniture, ornaments etc).  The list goes on.  If you can think it,
      it can be traded.  </p>

    <p>A lot of the time the biggest cost with getting a tradesman in, is their
      labour, which can be upward of $100 per hour depending on the trade.  Now
      not everybody is going to be able afford that for a minor job and they
      might put it out of sight or leave it for another day.  Next thing they
      know, that small job they could not afford has worsened has blown out into
      major repairs, leaving them in a tighter position than before.  If that
      same person was given the access to local repairmen and women, who were
      willing to do them a favour in exchange for something they can provide,
      I’m sure they would jump at the chance.</p>

    <p>For example, the old man down the road is an avid gardener and often has
      a surplus of fruit and veg.  One day the old man’s automatic garage door
      stops working, so he logs in to see if there is anybody close by who may
      be able to help.  He eventually finds an electrician that lives a few
      streets away and offers the tradesman some fresh fruit in exchange for his
      service.  The electrician see the value in the food and offers his time to
      help fix the problem, as long as the old man pays for whatever supplies
      are needed for the job at hand. With both parties agreeing on the terms,
      the exchange is made and the trade complete.  This had taken something
      that may have cost the old man hundreds of dollars and turned into
      something much more affordable. Also leaving the electrician with some
      beautiful home grown local produce.</p>

    <p>The problem the app is likely to face is personal accountability.  If one
      party is unsatisfied the platform will allow for a star rating out of 5
      that will be displayed next to the profile of the opposing party.  You
      must remember that the type of person that will be using this app are
      probably the same type of person who take great pride in their work and
      are willing to help others.  The fact that there is no exchange of money
      may dissuade the type of people looking to rip people off.  Hopefully
      these factors will keep the quality of what people are providing to the
      community at a premium.</p>

    <p>A reward system will be implemented to indicate to others that certain
      users are completing jobs at a standard that others are happy with.  For
      example, the user may receive rewards, such as medals or badges that can
      be displayed on their profile, to indicate to others of the quality of
      service etc.</p>

    <h2>Tools and Tech</h2>

    <p>The app will be displayed through the user’s device including but not
      limited to smart phone, tablets, laptops and PC’s and will be compatible
      with Windows, Mac OS and Android.  The User will have to enable location
      settings for the app to pinpoint their locations.  Information and data
      will be linked to servers that will be scaled up if/when it is need.
      Personal data will be protected by a firewall to defend against
      cyber-attacks.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>

    <p>A developer well versed in programs such as JavaScript, C# or C++ will be
      needed for competition of this application.  Chat software for
      user-to-user interaction will need to be implemented as will location
      software.  The only hardware to get the project off the ground would be
      a testing server and the teams Personal Computers and laptops.  The server
      will need to be able to be upgraded eventually to deal with growth.  A
      well-designed interface for ease of use will need to be created by a
      professional designer.  All these skills and tech are not going to be too
      hard to come by.  None of this is new technology, just a new way to use
      it.</p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>

    <p>With technology driving the wedge of isolation deeper and deeper into the
      cracks of our communities world-wide, we must do something before it is
      too late, we need to use these same technologies in our favour to benefit
      our existence.  With this application we may help mitigate other issues
      beyond our control and help us live a more sustainable and community-based
      existence.   If enough people were to get involved and use an app like
      this, we would not only be building community spirit and comradery, but
      we will bring down the cost of living for one another. In these uncertain
      times of conflict and inflation, the world may need something like
      this.  </p>
